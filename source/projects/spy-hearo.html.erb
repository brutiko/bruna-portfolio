        <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
        <p>Over 90 million people in Europe currently suffer from hearing loss, and due to an ageing population this number is likely to continue to increase. According to the World Health Organization, over 5% of the world’s population – 360 million people – has disabling hearing loss (328 million adults and 32 million children).</p>

        <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>Traditional analogue hearing aid only performed a limited array of functions (e.g., equalization and amplification). Generally, analogue hearing aids were calibrated by a specialist (audiologist) a single time and then given to patients. The hearing aids were generally calibrated to optimize hearing of voices (“cutting” other sounds). This resulted in poor quality of hearing in some situations, for example at concerts. New digital hearing aids have many additional functions (directionality, adaptation, spatial hearing enhancement, etc.) and settings (e.g., specific settings for speech or concerts or movies, etc.). A lot of calibration possibilities, but calibration is not easy! </p>

        <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
        <p>Spy hearo is the only learning app for young people and hearing impaired that allows self-assessment of your hearing ability and calibrates your hearing device in a better way through gamification.

        <h3>THE GAME</h3>
        <p>From outer space where silence reigns, you are coming on planet Earth for a spy mission. The City is full of different sounds, you have to explore different environments and gather information by hearing. The more areas the character explores, the better gets his/her hearing ability/ calibration. The final goal is to decode a secret message.</p>
