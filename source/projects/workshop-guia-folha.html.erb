        <h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
        <p>In a process of co-creation with a sport advisory we developed a new digital service of running advisory with real coaches to provide a better experience for people who wants to start running or already like to run.</p>

        <h3>WORKSHOP</h3>
        <p>In a scenario that smartphone and wearable devices are part of everyday life of people, we encountered a ruge range of people that start running by themselves. Our challenge was to understand how those people were changing their behaviors with technology and adapting running habits in their lives.</p>

          </figure>
        </div>

        <h3>RESULTS</h3>
        <p>We focused our efforts trying to understand a bit about the world of running. Through quantitative and qualitative research we understood runner's perception about running and their relationship with this universe. We did a benchmark to know about the existing market and trendings.<br/><br/>
        Talking with runners amateurs beginners, intermediate and advanced athletes and coaches. Some in order to performance, other fitness and some slimming. At the same time we took a deep immersion near a sports advisory to practice running and understand a little bit the feeling and the experience of running.</p>
